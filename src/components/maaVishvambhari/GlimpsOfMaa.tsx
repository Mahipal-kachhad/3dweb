          Mother created whole three layers like (1) Upper most Layer:- sky
          including celestial objects (2) Middle Layer: earth and (3) Lower
          most:- abyss. For proper managing of the world, she created Brahma,
          Vishnu and Mahesh (three Lords) on the most auspicious day of Akshaya
          Tritya (Akhatrij). She created all those lives who are swimming in
          water (aquatic), roaming on land (terrestrial) and flying in sky
          (spatial). She entrusted responsibility of their creation to Brahma,
          their breeding and nourishment to Vishnu and their salvation to
          Mahesh. Since then, they are controlling this huge system as per the
          wish and order of Mother. It's quite natural that the supreme power
          that created universe is known as MOTHER!!
